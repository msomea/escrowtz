    <h1>HOW DOES IT WORKS: 5 Key Steps</h1>
    <p>
        At EscrowTZ, we make the process of securing your transactions simple and efficient. 
        Our platform is designed to protect both buyers and sellers, ensuring that funds are 
        handled safely and that all conditions of the transaction are met before any money changes 
        hands. Here’s a step-by-step guide to how our escrow service works:
    </p>

    <h2> 1. Agreement and Escrow Account Setup </h2>

    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Initial Agreement:</b> The buyer and seller discuss and agree on the 
        terms of the transaction, including the price, delivery timeline, and 
        specific conditions that must be met.<br>
        <b>Account Creation:</b> An escrow account is created on the EscrowTZ
         platform. This account will hold the funds securely until all 
         conditions of the agreement are met.<br>
        <b>Escrow Instructions:</b> Both parties provide detailed instructions to EscrowTZ,
        ensuring clear understanding and expectations
    </p>
    
    <h2> 2. Depositing Funds </h2>

    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Buyer Deposit:</b> The buyer deposits the agreed-upon funds into the escrow account
        using a secure payment method. EscrowTZ supports various payment options for convenience.<br>
        <b>Confirmation:</b> EscrowTZ verifies the receipt of funds and notifies both parties.
        This step ensures that the funds are available and reserved for the transaction, 
        providing assurance to the seller.

    <h2> 3. Fulfillment of Conditions</h2>

    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Seller Delivers:</b> The seller fulfills their part of the agreement by delivering
        the goods or services to the buyer. This might include shipping a product, 
        providing a service, or delivering digital assets.<br>
        <b>Inspection Period:</b> The buyer is given a specified period to inspect the goods or 
        services. During this time, the buyer checks that all conditions and quality 
        standards are met as per the agreement.
    </p>

    <h2> 4. Verification and Approval</h2>
    <div class='img'>
        <img width='100px' height='100px' src="{% static 'accounts/blockchain.png' %}" alt="Blockchain">
    </div>
    <p>
    </b>
        <b>Buyer Approval:</b> If the buyer is satisfied with the delivery, they inform EscrowTZ
        to release the funds. This step confirms that the transaction terms have been met.<br>
        <b>Dispute Resolution:</b> If there are any issues or disputes, EscrowTZ steps in to mediate.
        The escrow agent reviews the terms, conditions, and evidence provided by both parties 
        to resolve the dispute fairly and impartially.
    </p>

    <h2> 5. Release of Funds</h2>
    <div class='img'>
        <img width='100px' height='100px' src="{% static 'accounts/blockchain.png' %}" alt="Blockchain">
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Funds Release:</b> Once the buyer’s approval is received, EscrowTZ releases the funds to the seller’s 
        account. This ensures that the seller is paid promptly for fulfilling their part of the agreement.<br>
        <b>Transaction Closure:</b> Both parties receive a confirmation of the completed transaction from EscrowTZ. 
        This includes a detailed record of the transaction for future reference.
